# task (deprecated) - Reviewers READ-ON
This is my final submission for Flutter Kerala Bootcamp 2021 GTech ATFG 

## Future Add-on

**- add events to google calendar using google calendar api**
honestly, I'm already late and i still need time (if) to implement this.

**BUT** hive boxes work , and added **Google sign in** as replacement for the missing checkpoint.

## How to make it work
### ðŸš« The packages are deprecated. Do a complete migration to latest flutter versions and also V2 embedding ðŸš«
Basic android flutter setup.

All deps available.

Only thing, 

To make google sign in work => create || login to GCP and from there,

set up OAuth consent screens and create credentials for Android and Web.

Also pass your keys which I DEFINITELY have not pushed to GitHub.


### THATS IT. Happy Programming :)
