This is my final submission for Flutter Kerala Bootcamp 2021 GTech ATFG 

## Future Add-on

**- add events to google calendar using google calendar api**
honestly, I'm already late and i still need time (if) to implement this.

**BUT** hive boxes work , and added **Google sign in** as replacement for the missing checkpoint.

## How to make it work
Basic android flutter setup.
All deps available.
Only thing, 
To make google sign in work => create || login to GCP and from there,
set up OAuth consent screens and create credentials for Android and Web.
Also pass your keys which I DEFINITELY have not pushed to GitHub.

### THATS IT. Happy Programming :)
